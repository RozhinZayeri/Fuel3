Hello!


To run the code as we mentioned in our package.json file ( "start": "node app.js"), you need to type " node app.js ".
You still might not be able to run the code and I believe this might be because of our database URL.
As you see in the app.js file, on the very top I am reading the dotenv file which is hidden from everyone on GitHub. 
In the .env we hide our DB URL since it contains our username and password. 
As written in app.js (const dbUrl = process.env.DB_URL;) the url is comming from the .env file.

To run the test you need to type "npm test"

In case you couldn't run the code PLEASE contact us on teams or email or on the blackboard in order for us to meet and share our screen to show you our IDE and run everything for you. 

Feel free to access the website using this URL at any time to test the functionality of the website. (https://still-headland-78644.herokuapp.com/) .


Lastly, our default branch is the "master" branch. 

BEST,
Group 5.
